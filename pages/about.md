*The Internet Observatory (Obsrva) is a vulnerability research project founded by independent security researcher [Tyler Butler](https://tbutler.org). Obsrva engages product vendors in coordinated disclosures, publishes vulnerability advisories, and creates proof of concept exploits.*

## Coordinated Disclosures  
Obsrva engages vendors of hardware, software, and internet-based services in coordinated disclosures after the discovery of vulnerabilities effecting their products. Following industry standards, vendors are provided identification of the vulnerability, statements addressing impact, and mitigation recommendations.  

## Vulnerability Advisories  
Obsrva coordinates with product vendors to publish vulnerability advisories on obsrva.org/advisories. Advisories allow customers, blue and red team operators, and the broader research community to access technical details and research methodology.

2.  [CVE-2021-35956](/about/2021/06/06/CVE-2021-35956.html)

## Proof of Concept Exploits  
Obsrva develops proof of concept exploits for discovered vulnerabilities and publishes them on the exploit database (exploit-db.com). PoC’s can also be found on GitHub where PR’s are welcome for the community to collaborate.

### Research Library  
Obsrva maintains the iOT Research Library, a collection of iOT and embedded devices available for loan by independent security researchers. The library provides access to unique, EOL, or other devices no longer under active research by Obsrva.
